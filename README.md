| [Sentiment Analysis in Marketing â€“ From Fundamentals to State-of-the-art](https://doi.org/10.15358/0344-1369-2025-1-45) | Marketing ZFP (C) | This paper presents a comprehensive sentiment analysis pipeline, validated through a systematic comparison of 12 machine learning models across diverse datasets, and demonstrates interpretability frameworks for understanding model classifications. Practical guidelines for model selection are provided, along with Python codes, to support researchers in applying the findings.|
| [Measuring technology acceptance over time using transfer models based on online customer reviews](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jretconser.2025.104278)| Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services (B) | This paper presents a novel approach to estimate the technology acceptance model (TAM) through online customer reviews, thus side-stepping the need for expensive surveys. We find that our machine learning model provides valid estimates of the TAM construct scores. This model can then be used to estimate the TAM for other products or services.
